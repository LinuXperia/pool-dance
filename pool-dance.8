.SH NAME
pool-dance \- Simple, lightweight and memory efficient Bitcoin mining pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pool-dance
.I [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B pool-dance
command.
.PP
.B pool-dance
is a Bitcoin mining pool service that focus on simplicity, efficiency and
scalability. It provides the core pool functionality and does not deal
with worker statistics or rewards. Instead, it uses log files to store all
relevant activity so it does not depend on databases or third parties to
operate.

For a complete pool service that provide real-time statistics and
other typical features, another program should open the log files that
.B pool-dance
generates and use it as source of information.

.B pool-dance
uses an asynchronous, event-driven loop and does efficient
I/O using epoll. It is written in C using the GLib and EventDance libraries
extensively.
